# ATP rankings stats analysis

This is a Python homework project for Computer Programming course (LTAT.03.001) at Tartu University.

The aim of this notebook is to analyse and visualize ATP rankings data.

This data was gathered from the ATP World Tour website and is used under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The data used includes ATP rankings from 1973 to 2017.

To view interactive content or to modify elements within the notebook, you must first clone or download the repository then run the notebook.

To run a Jupyter Notebook in a command line type in 'jupyter notebook'. It is going to print out a bunch of logging information, but it will also open up a browser into the Jupyter Notebook. And although it opens up in a web browser, it is not really working across the internet. It is a program that is running on your computer that just happens to be rendered through a web browser.


If you have Python 3 installed then run:
```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ jupyter notebook
```

If you want to shut down the Jupyter Notebook, go to File -> Close and Halt. To shut down the notebook server, go back to the terminal and type Ctrl C -> y (for yes).


Another great option is to use [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab). You can find the installation guide if you scroll down on their GitHub page. After you have installed JupyterLab, you can launch it by typing in 'jupyter lab' in the terminal. When you are done, go to File -> Close and Shutdown Notebook, to close down the notebook and the JupyterLab server.
